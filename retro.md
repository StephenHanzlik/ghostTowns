Start:


Make and reuse functions and code blocks.   Make code stronger for handling null observations.   Make my data pull of off 30 / 60/ 390 day intervals instead of months/ years.   


Start using pivotal tracker and make more in depth descriptions and use all features.


Make sure that pivotal tracker is readable to a use or non programmer.   Make it legible and clearly understandable.  


Present better by looking up and making eye contact with audience.   Use language similar to Anna’s ‘we’, ‘this product’, make sure to hit the points you are supposed to touch upon.  “Biggest challenge”, “Who it is meant for”.

Do the back end and logic first before the front end (at least try this)



Stop:


Using empty divs and sections to assist in layout.   There is a better way to do this.  


Stop being so disorganized with code.    Use tracker entries that correspond to commented out directions in code.    


Making wasteful AJAX calls and streamline.  




Continue:


Enjoying work and staying focussed.    Playing with data and engaging in real life applicable things that stimulate and challenge me.   Staying rad.
